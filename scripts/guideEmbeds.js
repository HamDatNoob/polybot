Tension is when the forces on the material are pulling away from each other, tearing it. Both types of building strategies have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are incredibly useful in their circumstances. Some materials are better in tension or compression; for example, cable and rope are exceptional in tension but do not work in compression at all, but roads are great at it. Refer to the gif below to observe the differences between the two types of force.',
